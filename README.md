## Hello World !

I'm interested in computer vision using deep learning based on Python. These days, I usually study my major, and I study deep learning and algorithms in my spare time. I even read books. My plan is to admit to the graduate school majoring CS in 2023. 

Project proposals using Python are always welcome. Thank you!
